# CS456:  Computer networks

## Chapter1: Overview

### What is Internet

- The components of the internet
  - Computing devices, or **hosts**. They are endpoints at Internet's edge, running network apps
  - Packet switches: forward packets (routers and switches)
  - Communication links: fiber, copper, radio, satellite
    - transmission rate: bandwidth
  - Networks: collection of devices, routers and links
  - Internet: _"network of networks"_
- The internet in a "services" view
  - The internet is an infrastructure that provides services to applications
  - provides API to network applications
- The internet also consists of **protocols**



### Protocols

Protocols define the **format, order of messages sent and received** among networks entities, and **actions taken** on message transmission and received.

### Closer look to internet components

#### Access network

- Access networks: cable-based access

  - One cable may carry data to various channels, which is split with a splitter following frequency division multiplexing (FDM) algorithm

- Access networks: home networks

  - ![1620644580218](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1620644580218.png)

- Links: physical media

  - guided media: signals propagated in solid media: copper, fiber...
  - unguided media: signals propagated freely: radio
  - Twisted pair (TP): two twisted copper wire, widely used as physical media in LAN
  - Coaxial cable: two concentric copper conductors, bidirectional
  - Fiber optic cable: widely used as long-distance physical media
    - glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
    - high-speed operation & low error rate

  - Wireless radio: no physical "wire"
    - signal carried in various bands in electromagnetic spectrum
    - Radio link types:
      - Wireless LAN (Wifi)
      - wide-area (e.g. 4G cellular)
      - Bluetooth
      - terrestrial microwave
      - satellite

#### Network edge

- Host: sends packets of data
  - takes application message
  - breaks into smaller chunks, known as packets, of length $L$ bits
  - transmits packets into access network at transmission rate $R$ bits per second (aka link capacity, aka link bandwidth)
  - packet transmission delay = $\frac{L}{R}$ : the time of the last bit leaving the transmitter 

#### Network core

The mesh of interconnected routers

- **packet-switching**: hosts break application layer message into packets
  - **routing**: make decision on which route this packet should go
  - **forwarding**: aka switching, move arriving packets from router's input link to appropriate router output line
- packet-switching **queueing**: if arrival rate to link exceeds transmission rate of link for some period of time,
  - packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link
  - packets can be dropped (lost) if memory in router fills up

- Numerical example: One-hop system, $L=10 Kbits, R=100 Mbps$, then the one-hop transmission delay = $0.1 msec$. Then to transmit 3 packages, the overall delay is $0.4 msec$
- **circuit switching**: an alternative to packet switching
  - The physical media is divided into several channels/circits
  - In each "call", resources are allocated to the call
  - no sharing resources is granted
  - commonly used in traditional telephone netwoks

- Packet switching versus circuit switching
  - Packet switching could server more users since it is dynamic
  - Packet switching may generate packet delay and loss due to buffer overflow

#### Network of networks

- At "center": small number of well-connected large networks
  - "tier-1" commercial ISPs
  - content provider networks



### Performance: loss, delay, throughput

#### Packet delay

![1621234197492](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1621234197492.png)

- $d_{proc}$: check bit errors, determine output link, typically < microsecs
- $d_{prop}$: length of physical link / propagation speed (close to light speed)

- $d_{queue}$: let $a$ denote the average packet arrival rate, $L$ denote the packet length, 4$R$ denote the link bandwidth, then we define $$\text{traffic intensity} = \frac{La}{R}$$
  - traffic intensity ~ 0: avg. queueing delay small
  - traffic intensity -> 1: avg. queueing delay large 

- __traceroute__ program: provides delay measurement from source to router along the path

#### Packet loss

#### Throughput

The rate of data transmission (bits/sec)

- bottleneck link: link on end-end path that constraints the throughput



### Security

#### Bad Guys

- **IP sniffing**
  - broadcast media (shared Ethernet, wireless)
  - promiscuous network interface reads/records all packets passing by
- fake identity
  - **IP spoofing**: injection of packet with false source address

- **Denial of Service (DOS attack)**: attackers make resources unavailable to legitimate traffic by overwhelming resource with fake traffic
  1. Select a target
  2. Break into hosts around the network (botnet)
  3. Send packets to target from compromised hosts

#### Lines of defense

- **Authentication**: proving you are who you say you are
- **Confidentiality**: via encryption
- **Integrity checks**: digital signatures prevent/detect tampering
- **Access restrictions:** password-protected VPNs
- **Firewalls**: middleboxes in access and core networks



### Protocol layers, service models

#### Layer-structured protocols

![1621240445684](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1621240445684.png)

- Application layer: create a **message** $M$
- Transport layer: encapsulates application-layer message $M$ with transport layer header $H_t$ to create a transport layer **segment**
  - $H_t$ used by transport layer protocol to implement its service
- Network layer: encapsulates transport-layer segment with network layer header $H_n$ to create a network layer **datagram**
- Link layer: encapsulates network-layer datagram with link layer header $H_l$ to create a link layer **frame**

![1621240979066](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1621240979066.png)



## Chapter2: Application Layer

### Principles of network applications

#### Client-server paradigm

- Server: always-on host
  - permanent IP addresss
  - often in data centers, for scaling
- Client: contact, communicate with server
  - may be intermittently connected
  - may have dynamic IP addresses
  - do not communicate directly with each other
  - examples: HTTPS, IMAP

#### Peer-Peer architecture

- no always-on server 
- arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
  - self scalability: new peers bring new service capacity
- peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
- example: P2P file sharing

#### Processes communication

- client process: process that initiates communication
- server process: process that waits to be contacted
- processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages
  - **Socket**: process sends/receives messages to/from its socket, which can be considered as a door between application layer and transport layer
- Addressing processes: to receive messages, process must have **identifier**
  - host device has unique 32-bit **IP address**
    - This is not enough to identify a process since there may be many processes running on the same machine
  - **Port number:** 16-bit number that identify the process on the machine
    - HTTP server: 80
    - mail server: 25
  - To send HTTP message to uwaterloo.ca web server: 
    - Ip address 129.97.208.23
    - port number 80

#### An application-layer protocol defines:

- **types of messages** exchanged: request, response
- **message syntax:** what fields in messages and how fields are delineated
- **message semantics:** meaning of information in fields
- **rules**: when and how processes send and respond to messages

#### What transport service does an app need?

- **reliability**: some apps (eg. file transfer, web transactions) require 100% reliable data transfer
- **timing**: some apps (eg. Internet telephony, interactive games) require low delay to be effective
- **Throughput**: some apps (eg. multimedia) require minimum amount of throughput to be effective
- **Security**

![1622014036066](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1622014036066.png)



#### Internet transport protocols services

##### TCP service

- **reliable transport** between sending and receiving process
- **flow control**: sender won't overwhelm receiver
- **congestion control:** throttle sender when network overloaded

- **connection-oriented:** setup(handshaking) required between client and server processes
- Does not provide: timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security

##### UDP service

- **unreliable data transfer** between sending and receiving process
- does not provide: anything above
- somewhat faster than TCP

![1622014740013](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1622014740013.png)

##### Securing TCP

**Vanilla TCP and UDP sockets:**

- no encryption
- cleartext passwords sent into socket traverse Internet in cleartext

**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**

- provides encrypted TCP connections
- data integrity
- end-point authentication



### Web and HTTP

- Web page consists of objects, each of which can be stored on different Web servers
- objects can be HTML file, JPEG images....
- web page consists of **base HTML-file** which includes several **referenced objects**, each addressable by a **URL**

#### HTTP

- **HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol**

  - client: browser that requests, receives, and displays web objects
  - server: web server sends objects in response to requests

- HTTP uses **TCP**:

  - client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, port 80
  - server accepts TCP connection from client
  - HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser and Web server
  - TCP connection closed

- HTTP is **"stateless"**

  - server maintains no information about past client requests (page history)

- Response time:

  - **RTT** (Round trip time): time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
  - HTTP response time (per object)
    - one RTT to initiate TCP connection
    - one RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response return
    - object/file transmission time

- Two types of HTTP connection

  - Non-persistent HTTP:

    1. TCP connection opened
    2. at most one object sent over TCP connection
    3. TCP connection closed

    **Response time**: 2RTT * Number of objects + transmission time

  - Persistent HTTP: 

    1. TCP connection opened to a server
    2. multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client and that server
    3. TCP connection closed

    **Response time**: 1RTT * Number of objects + transmission time

#### Two types of HTTP messages: request, response

**HTTP request message: ASCII (human-readable format)**

![1622016588194](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1622016588194.png)

- **POST** method:
  - web page often includes form input
  - user input sent from client to server in entity body of HTTP POST request message
- GET method
  - include user data in UTL field of HTTP GET request message
- **PUT** method
  - uploads new file to server
  - completely replaces file that exists at specified URL with content in entity body of PUT HTTP request message

**HTTP response message**

![1622016880368](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1622016880368.png)

- **Status codes:**
  - 200 OK: request succeeded
  - 404 Not Found: requested document not found on this server

#### Maintaining user/server state: cookies

Four components:

- cookie header line of HTTP response message
- cookie header line in next HTTP request message
- cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's browser
- back-end database at Web site

Cookies are used for:

- authorization
- shopping carts
- recommendations
- user session state (Web e-mail)

#### Web caches

- user configures browser to point to a local Web cache
- browser sends all HTTP requests to cache
  - if object in cache: cache returns object to client
  - else cache requests object from origin server, caches received object, then returns object to client
- server tells cache about objects's allowable caching in response header

- **Conditional GET**: do note send object if cache has up-to-date cached version
  - client: specify date of cached copy in HTTP request
  - server: response contains no object if cached copy is up-to-date (304 Not Modified)

### Socket programming

Two socket types for two transport services:

- UDP: unreliable datagram i.e. expecting application to write datagrams
- TCP: reliable, byte stream-oriented i.e. expecting application to write bytes

#### Socket programming with TCP

TCP provides reliable, in-order byte transmission between client and serer

- Client must contact server, thus the server process must first be running
- Client create TCP socket, specifying IP address, port number of server process
- When client create TCP socket, client TCP establishes connection to the server TCP
- When contacted by a client, the server **creates a new socket** to communicate with that particular client
  - This allows server to talk with multiple clients

### E-mail, SMTP, IMAP

**Three major components**

- user agents
  - mail reader, composing, editing, reading mails
- mail servers
  - mailbox contains incoming messages for user
  - message queue of outgoing mails
- simple mail transfer protocol: SMTP

SMTP uses TCP to transfer mail to server, port 25

**Three phases of transfer**

- SMTP handshaking
- SMTP transfer of messages
- SMTP closure

#### Retrieving email: mail access protocols

- SMTP: delivery/storage of email messages to receiver's server
- IMAP/HTTP: retrieve mail from the server

### DNS: Domain Name System

Internet hosts, routers:

- Ip address (32 bit) used for addressing datagrams
- name, e.g. uwaterloo.ca used by humans

**DNS**

- **distributed database** implemented in hierarchy of many name servers
  - **root name servers**: official, contact-of-last-resort by name servers that can not resolve name, 13 logical root name servers worldwide
  - **Top-Level Domain**: responsible for .com, .org, .net.....
  - **Authoritative DNS servers**: organization's own DNS servers, providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization's named hosts
  - **Local DNS name servers:** when hosts makes DNS query, it is sent to local DNS server
- **application-layer protocol**: hosts, DNS servers communicate to resolve names
  - note core internet function implemented as application-layer protocol
  - complexity at network's edge

**DNS services:**

- hostname-to-IP-address translation
- host aliasing
- mail server aliasing

- load distribution
  - replicated Web servers: many IP addresses correspond to one name

**DNS protocol messages:**

DNS **query** and **reply** messages, both have same format

### P2P architecture

- No always-on server
- peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
  - self scalability
- peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses

**File distribution time**

- client-server: $N * F$ to be uploaded by the server, and $F$ to be downloaded by each client. $D_{c-s} \geq max\{NF/u_s, F/d_{min}\}$ where $d_{min}$= min client download rate

  - Clearly the time is linear with $N$

- P2P: $D_{P2P} > max\{F/u_s, F/d_{min}, NF/(u_s+\sum u_i)\}$

  - server uploads at least one copy
  - each client download file copy
  - clients as aggregate must download $NF$ bits, the max upload rate is $u_s+\sum u_i$

  - as $N$ grows, $\sum u_i$ also grows

#### BitTorrent

- file divided into 256KB chunks
- swarm: group of peers exchanging chunks of a file
- tracker: tracks peers participation in swarm (a server, does not participate the file exchange) (no longer used in the latest implementation)
- when Alice arrives
  - she downloads the torrent of 'XYZ', which includes the url of one tracker of that file
  - connect to the tracker, receive a list of peers
  - while downloading, peer uploads chunks to other peers
- Requesting chunks:
  - at any given time, different peers have different subsets of file chunks
  - periodically, Alice asks each peer for the list of chunks that they have
  - Alice requests missing chunks from peers, **rarest first**
- Sending chunks: **tit-for-tat**
  - Alice sends chunks to those four peers currently sending her chunks at highest rate
    - other peers are **choked** by Alice (do not receive chunks from her)
    - re-evaluate top 4 every 10 secs
  - every 30 secs: randomly select another peer, starts sending chunks
    - optimistically unchoke the peer
  - Higher upload rate could find better trading partners, get file faster

### Video Streaming and CDNs: context

- **Streaming stored video**: HTTP is mostly used

  - Main challenge: server-to-client bandwidth will vary over time, with changing network congestion levels (in house, access network, network core, video server)

  - Streaming multimedia: **DASH** (Dynamic, Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)

    - **server**: Divides video file into multiple chunks, each chunk encoded at multiple different rates, and stored in different files
    - files replicated in various CDN nodes
    - manifest file: provides URLs for different chunks

    - **client**: periodically estimates server-to-client bandwidth
    - consulting manifest, requests one chunk at a time
    - Client is intelligent, it determines
      - when to request chunk (so that buffer starvation, or overflow does not occur)
      - what encoding rate to request (higher quality when more bandwidth available)
      - where to request chunk (can request from URL server that is close to client or has high available bandwidth)
    - ***Streaming video = encoding + DASH + playout buffer***

  - **Content distribution networks (CDNs)**

    - store/serve multiple copies of videos at multiple geographically distributed sites (CDN)
      - enter deep: push CDN servers deep into many access networks
      - bring home: smaller number (10's) of larger clusters in POPs near access nets

## Chapter 3: Transport Layer

### Transport services and protocols

The **transport layer**

- provide **logical communication** between application processes running on different hosts
- transport protocols actions in tend systems:
  - sender: breaks application messages into **segments**, passes to network layer
  - receiver: reassembles **segments** into messages, passes to application layer

Two **transport protocols**: **TCP, UDP**

### Multiplexing and demultiplexing

- **Multiplexing**: handle data from different sockets and add header to them on sender side
- **Demultiplexing**: use header info to deliver received segments to correct socket
  - host receives IP datagrams, containing IP address and port number to direct segment to appropriate socket
  - UDP demultiplexing: only destination IP address and port number is required, i.e. messages from different sender could be send to the same UDP socket
  - TCP demultiplexing: the 4-tuple (source IP, source port number, dest IP, dest port number) is required, thus 1-to-N server client pattern is possible

### UDP: User Datagram Protocol

- connectionless, "best effort" service, "bare bones", **fast**
- no connection establishment (connection setup adds delay)
- simple: no connection state at sender, receiver
- small header size
- no congestion control
  - UDP can blast away as fast as desired
  - can function in the face of congestion

- Used in

  - streaming multimedia apps (loss tolerant, rate sensitive)
  - DNS
  - SNMP
  - HTTP/3

- if reliable transfer / congestion control needed over UDP: add needed reliability at **application layer**

- UDP segment header

  ![1623070903703](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623070903703.png)

  - UDP checksum: detect errors (i.e. flipped bits) in transmitted segment
    - sender: treat contents of UDP segments (including UDP header fields and IP addresses) as sequence of 16-bit integers, and add them together, store it in the checksum field
    - receiver: compute checksum of received segment, check if computed checksum equals checksum field value

### Principles of reliable data transfer

![1623754121289](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623754121289.png)

Sender and receiver do not know each other, unless communicated via a message

- Reliable data transfer protocol (RDT) interfaces
  - `rdt_send()`: called from above (by app). Passed data to deliver to receiver upper layer
  - `udt_send()`: called by RDT to transfer packet over unreliable channel
  - `rdt_rcv()`: called when packet arrives on receiver side of channel
  - `deliver_data()`: called by RDT to deliver data to upper layer

**Initial attempt**

- Stop and wait: sender sends one packet, then waits for the response
- Communicate with ACK and retransmit on failure to deal with bit flips
  - Add checksum to ACK, and use sequence number to deal with bit flips on ACK
- Use countdown timer to interrupt after "reasonable" amount of time to deal with packet losses

- The performance of above method is not good since "stop and wait" is used
  - $U_{sender}$: utilization - fraction of time sender busy sending
  - example: 1 Gbps link, 15 ms prop. delay, 8000 bit packet then
    - time to transmit packet into channel: $D_{trans} = \frac{L}{R} = 8ms$
    - $U_{sender} = \frac{L/R}{RTT+L/R} = \frac{0.008}{30.008} = 0.00027$, which is really bad

**Solution: pipelined protocols operation**

- $n$-packet pipelining increases utilization by a factor of $n$
- Go-Back-N
  - sender: "window" of up to $N$, consecutive transmitted but unACKed pkts
    - $k$-bit seq number in pkt header
    - ![1623759238953](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623759238953.png)
    - ![1623759972181](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623759972181.png)
- Selective repeat
  - Receiver individually acknowledges all correctly received packets
    - buffers packets, as needed, for eventual in-order delivery to upper layer
    - sender times-out/retransmits individually for unACKed packets
      - sender maintains timer for each unACKed pkt
      - sender Window size limits the number of on-flight packets
    - ![1623760546270](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623760546270.png)
    - A fatal error: cannot use only $N+1$ seq numbers when the window size is $N$
      -
