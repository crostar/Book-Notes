# CS456:  Computer networks

## Chapter1: Overview

### What is Internet

- The components of the internet
  - Computing devices, or **hosts**. They are endpoints at Internet's edge, running network apps
  - Packet switches: forward packets (routers and switches)
  - Communication links: fiber, copper, radio, satellite
    - transmission rate: bandwidth
  - Networks: collection of devices, routers and links
  - Internet: _"network of networks"_
- The internet in a "services" view
  - The internet is an infrastructure that provides services to applications
  - provides API to network applications
- The internet also consists of **protocols**



### Protocols

Protocols define the **format, order of messages sent and received** among networks entities, and **actions taken** on message transmission and received.

### Closer look to internet components

#### Access network

- Access networks: cable-based access

  - One cable may carry data to various channels, which is split with a splitter following frequency division multiplexing (FDM) algorithm

- Access networks: home networks

  - ![1620644580218](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1620644580218.png)

- Links: physical media

  - guided media: signals propagated in solid media: copper, fiber...
  - unguided media: signals propagated freely: radio
  - Twisted pair (TP): two twisted copper wire, widely used as physical media in LAN
  - Coaxial cable: two concentric copper conductors, bidirectional
  - Fiber optic cable: widely used as long-distance physical media
    - glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
    - high-speed operation & low error rate

  - Wireless radio: no physical "wire"
    - signal carried in various bands in electromagnetic spectrum
    - Radio link types:
      - Wireless LAN (Wifi)
      - wide-area (e.g. 4G cellular)
      - Bluetooth
      - terrestrial microwave
      - satellite

#### Network edge

- Host: sends packets of data
  - takes application message
  - breaks into smaller chunks, known as packets, of length $L$ bits
  - transmits packets into access network at transmission rate $R$ bits per second (aka link capacity, aka link bandwidth)
  - packet transmission delay = $\frac{L}{R}$ : the time of the last bit leaving the transmitter 

#### Network core

The mesh of interconnected routers

- **packet-switching**: hosts break application layer message into packets
  - **routing**: make decision on which route this packet should go
  - **forwarding**: aka switching, move arriving packets from router's input link to appropriate router output line
- packet-switching **queueing**: if arrival rate to link exceeds transmission rate of link for some period of time,
  - packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link
  - packets can be dropped (lost) if memory in router fills up

- Numerical example: One-hop system, $L=10 Kbits, R=100 Mbps$, then the one-hop transmission delay = $0.1 msec$. Then to transmit 3 packages, the overall delay is $0.4 msec$
- **circuit switching**: an alternative to packet switching
  - The physical media is divided into several channels/circits
  - In each "call", resources are allocated to the call
  - no sharing resources is granted
  - commonly used in traditional telephone netwoks

- Packet switching versus circuit switching
  - Packet switching could server more users since it is dynamic
  - Packet switching may generate packet delay and loss due to buffer overflow

#### Network of networks

- At "center": small number of well-connected large networks
  - "tier-1" commercial ISPs
  - content provider networks



### Performance: loss, delay, throughput

#### Packet delay

![1621234197492](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1621234197492.png)

- $d_{proc}$: check bit errors, determine output link, typically < microsecs
- $d_{prop}$: length of physical link / propagation speed (close to light speed)

- $d_{queue}$: let $a$ denote the average packet arrival rate, $L$ denote the packet length, 4$R$ denote the link bandwidth, then we define $$\text{traffic intensity} = \frac{La}{R}$$
  - traffic intensity ~ 0: avg. queueing delay small
  - traffic intensity -> 1: avg. queueing delay large 

- __traceroute__ program: provides delay measurement from source to router along the path

#### Packet loss

#### Throughput

The rate of data transmission (bits/sec)

- bottleneck link: link on end-end path that constraints the throughput



### Security

#### Bad Guys

- **IP sniffing**
  - broadcast media (shared Ethernet, wireless)
  - promiscuous network interface reads/records all packets passing by
- fake identity
  - **IP spoofing**: injection of packet with false source address

- **Denial of Service (DOS attack)**: attackers make resources unavailable to legitimate traffic by overwhelming resource with fake traffic
  1. Select a target
  2. Break into hosts around the network (botnet)
  3. Send packets to target from compromised hosts

#### Lines of defense

- **Authentication**: proving you are who you say you are
- **Confidentiality**: via encryption
- **Integrity checks**: digital signatures prevent/detect tampering
- **Access restrictions:** password-protected VPNs
- **Firewalls**: middleboxes in access and core networks



### Protocol layers, service models

#### Layer-structured protocols

![1621240445684](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1621240445684.png)

- Application layer: create a **message** $M$
- Transport layer: encapsulates application-layer message $M$ with transport layer header $H_t$ to create a transport layer **segment**
  - $H_t$ used by transport layer protocol to implement its service
- Network layer: encapsulates transport-layer segment with network layer header $H_n$ to create a network layer **datagram**
- Link layer: encapsulates network-layer datagram with link layer header $H_l$ to create a link layer **frame**

![1621240979066](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1621240979066.png)



## Chapter2: Application Layer

### Principles of network applications

#### Client-server paradigm

- Server: always-on host
  - permanent IP addresss
  - often in data centers, for scaling
- Client: contact, communicate with server
  - may be intermittently connected
  - may have dynamic IP addresses
  - do not communicate directly with each other
  - examples: HTTPS, IMAP

#### Peer-Peer architecture

- no always-on server 
- arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
  - self scalability: new peers bring new service capacity
- peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
- example: P2P file sharing

#### Processes communication

- client process: process that initiates communication
- server process: process that waits to be contacted
- processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages
  - **Socket**: process sends/receives messages to/from its socket, which can be considered as a door between application layer and transport layer
- Addressing processes: to receive messages, process must have **identifier**
  - host device has unique 32-bit **IP address**
    - This is not enough to identify a process since there may be many processes running on the same machine
  - **Port number:** 16-bit number that identify the process on the machine
    - HTTP server: 80
    - mail server: 25
  - To send HTTP message to uwaterloo.ca web server: 
    - Ip address 129.97.208.23
    - port number 80

#### An application-layer protocol defines:

- **types of messages** exchanged: request, response
- **message syntax:** what fields in messages and how fields are delineated
- **message semantics:** meaning of information in fields
- **rules**: when and how processes send and respond to messages

#### What transport service does an app need?

- **reliability**: some apps (eg. file transfer, web transactions) require 100% reliable data transfer
- **timing**: some apps (eg. Internet telephony, interactive games) require low delay to be effective
- **Throughput**: some apps (eg. multimedia) require minimum amount of throughput to be effective
- **Security**

![1622014036066](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1622014036066.png)



#### Internet transport protocols services

##### TCP service

- **reliable transport** between sending and receiving process
- **flow control**: sender won't overwhelm receiver
- **congestion control:** throttle sender when network overloaded

- **connection-oriented:** setup(handshaking) required between client and server processes
- Does not provide: timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security

##### UDP service

- **unreliable data transfer** between sending and receiving process
- does not provide: anything above
- somewhat faster than TCP

![1622014740013](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1622014740013.png)

##### Securing TCP

**Vanilla TCP and UDP sockets:**

- no encryption
- cleartext passwords sent into socket traverse Internet in cleartext

**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**

- provides encrypted TCP connections
- data integrity
- end-point authentication



### Web and HTTP

- Web page consists of objects, each of which can be stored on different Web servers
- objects can be HTML file, JPEG images....
- web page consists of **base HTML-file** which includes several **referenced objects**, each addressable by a **URL**

#### HTTP

- **HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol**

  - client: browser that requests, receives, and displays web objects
  - server: web server sends objects in response to requests

- HTTP uses **TCP**:

  - client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, port 80
  - server accepts TCP connection from client
  - HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser and Web server
  - TCP connection closed

- HTTP is **"stateless"**

  - server maintains no information about past client requests (page history)

- Response time:

  - **RTT** (Round trip time): time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
  - HTTP response time (per object)
    - one RTT to initiate TCP connection
    - one RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response return
    - object/file transmission time

- Two types of HTTP connection

  - Non-persistent HTTP:

    1. TCP connection opened
    2. at most one object sent over TCP connection
    3. TCP connection closed

    **Response time**: 2RTT * Number of objects + transmission time

  - Persistent HTTP: 

    1. TCP connection opened to a server
    2. multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client and that server
    3. TCP connection closed

    **Response time**: 1RTT * Number of objects + transmission time

#### Two types of HTTP messages: request, response

**HTTP request message: ASCII (human-readable format)**

![1622016588194](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1622016588194.png)

- **POST** method:
  - web page often includes form input
  - user input sent from client to server in entity body of HTTP POST request message
- GET method
  - include user data in UTL field of HTTP GET request message
- **PUT** method
  - uploads new file to server
  - completely replaces file that exists at specified URL with content in entity body of PUT HTTP request message

**HTTP response message**

![1622016880368](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1622016880368.png)

- **Status codes:**
  - 200 OK: request succeeded
  - 404 Not Found: requested document not found on this server

#### Maintaining user/server state: cookies

Four components:

- cookie header line of HTTP response message
- cookie header line in next HTTP request message
- cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's browser
- back-end database at Web site

Cookies are used for:

- authorization
- shopping carts
- recommendations
- user session state (Web e-mail)

#### Web caches

- user configures browser to point to a local Web cache
- browser sends all HTTP requests to cache
  - if object in cache: cache returns object to client
  - else cache requests object from origin server, caches received object, then returns object to client
- server tells cache about objects's allowable caching in response header

- **Conditional GET**: do note send object if cache has up-to-date cached version
  - client: specify date of cached copy in HTTP request
  - server: response contains no object if cached copy is up-to-date (304 Not Modified)

### Socket programming

Two socket types for two transport services:

- UDP: unreliable datagram i.e. expecting application to write datagrams
- TCP: reliable, byte stream-oriented i.e. expecting application to write bytes

#### Socket programming with TCP

TCP provides reliable, in-order byte transmission between client and serer

- Client must contact server, thus the server process must first be running
- Client create TCP socket, specifying IP address, port number of server process
- When client create TCP socket, client TCP establishes connection to the server TCP
- When contacted by a client, the server **creates a new socket** to communicate with that particular client
  - This allows server to talk with multiple clients

![1622779391804](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1622779391804.png)

### E-mail, SMTP, IMAP

**Three major components**

- user agents
  - mail reader, composing, editing, reading mails
- mail servers
  - mailbox contains incoming messages for user
  - message queue of outgoing mails
- simple mail transfer protocol: SMTP

SMTP uses TCP to transfer mail to server, port 25

**Three phases of transfer**

- SMTP handshaking
- SMTP transfer of messages
- SMTP closure

#### Retrieving email: mail access protocols

- SMTP: delivery/storage of email messages to receiver's server
- IMAP/HTTP: retrieve mail from the server

### DNS: Domain Name System

Internet hosts, routers:

- Ip address (32 bit) used for addressing datagrams
- name, e.g. uwaterloo.ca used by humans

**DNS**

- **distributed database** implemented in hierarchy of many name servers
  - **root name servers**: official, contact-of-last-resort by name servers that can not resolve name, 13 logical root name servers worldwide
  - **Top-Level Domain**: responsible for .com, .org, .net.....
  - **Authoritative DNS servers**: organization's own DNS servers, providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization's named hosts
  - **Local DNS name servers:** when hosts makes DNS query, it is sent to local DNS server
- **application-layer protocol**: hosts, DNS servers communicate to resolve names
  - note core internet function implemented as application-layer protocol
  - complexity at network's edge

**DNS services:**

- hostname-to-IP-address translation
- host aliasing
- mail server aliasing

- load distribution
  - replicated Web servers: many IP addresses correspond to one name

**DNS protocol messages:**

DNS **query** and **reply** messages, both have same format

### P2P architecture

- No always-on server
- peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
  - self scalability
- peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses

**File distribution time**

- client-server: $N * F$ to be uploaded by the server, and $F$ to be downloaded by each client. $D_{c-s} \geq max\{NF/u_s, F/d_{min}\}$ where $d_{min}$= min client download rate

  - Clearly the time is linear with $N$

- P2P: $D_{P2P} > max\{F/u_s, F/d_{min}, NF/(u_s+\sum u_i)\}$

  - server uploads at least one copy
  - each client download file copy
  - clients as aggregate must download $NF$ bits, the max upload rate is $u_s+\sum u_i$

  - as $N$ grows, $\sum u_i$ also grows

#### BitTorrent

- file divided into 256KB chunks
- swarm: group of peers exchanging chunks of a file
- tracker: tracks peers participation in swarm (a server, does not participate the file exchange) (no longer used in the latest implementation)
- when Alice arrives
  - she downloads the torrent of 'XYZ', which includes the url of one tracker of that file
  - connect to the tracker, receive a list of peers
  - while downloading, peer uploads chunks to other peers
- Requesting chunks:
  - at any given time, different peers have different subsets of file chunks
  - periodically, Alice asks each peer for the list of chunks that they have
  - Alice requests missing chunks from peers, **rarest first**
- Sending chunks: **tit-for-tat**
  - Alice sends chunks to those four peers currently sending her chunks at highest rate
    - other peers are **choked** by Alice (do not receive chunks from her)
    - re-evaluate top 4 every 10 secs
  - every 30 secs: randomly select another peer, starts sending chunks
    - optimistically unchoke the peer
  - Higher upload rate could find better trading partners, get file faster

### Video Streaming and CDNs: context

- **Streaming stored video**: HTTP is mostly used

  - Main challenge: server-to-client bandwidth will vary over time, with changing network congestion levels (in house, access network, network core, video server)

  - Streaming multimedia: **DASH** (Dynamic, Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)

    - **server**: Divides video file into multiple chunks, each chunk encoded at multiple different rates, and stored in different files
    - files replicated in various CDN nodes
    - manifest file: provides URLs for different chunks

    - **client**: periodically estimates server-to-client bandwidth
    - consulting manifest, requests one chunk at a time
    - Client is intelligent, it determines
      - when to request chunk (so that buffer starvation, or overflow does not occur)
      - what encoding rate to request (higher quality when more bandwidth available)
      - where to request chunk (can request from URL server that is close to client or has high available bandwidth)
    - ***Streaming video = encoding + DASH + playout buffer***

  - **Content distribution networks (CDNs)**

    - store/serve multiple copies of videos at multiple geographically distributed sites (CDN)
      - enter deep: push CDN servers deep into many access networks
      - bring home: smaller number (10's) of larger clusters in POPs near access nets

## Chapter 3: Transport Layer

### Transport services and protocols

The **transport layer**

- provide **logical communication** between application processes running on different hosts
- transport protocols actions in tend systems:
  - sender: breaks application messages into **segments**, passes to network layer
  - receiver: reassembles **segments** into messages, passes to application layer

Two **transport protocols**: **TCP, UDP**

### Multiplexing and demultiplexing

- **Multiplexing**: handle data from different sockets and add header to them on sender side
- **Demultiplexing**: use header info to deliver received segments to correct socket
  - host receives IP datagrams, containing IP address and port number to direct segment to appropriate socket
  - UDP demultiplexing: only destination IP address and port number is required, i.e. messages from different sender could be send to the same UDP socket
  - TCP demultiplexing: the 4-tuple (source IP, source port number, dest IP, dest port number) is required, thus 1-to-N server client pattern is possible

### UDP: User Datagram Protocol

- connectionless, "best effort" service, "bare bones", **fast**
- no connection establishment (connection setup adds delay)
- simple: no connection state at sender, receiver
- small header size
- no congestion control
  - UDP can blast away as fast as desired
  - can function in the face of congestion

- Used in

  - streaming multimedia apps (loss tolerant, rate sensitive)
  - DNS
  - SNMP
  - HTTP/3

- if reliable transfer / congestion control needed over UDP: add needed reliability at **application layer**

- UDP segment header

  ![1623070903703](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623070903703.png)

  - UDP checksum: detect errors (i.e. flipped bits) in transmitted segment
    - sender: treat contents of UDP segments (including UDP header fields and IP addresses) as sequence of 16-bit integers, and add them together, store it in the checksum field
    - receiver: compute checksum of received segment, check if computed checksum equals checksum field value

### Principles of reliable data transfer

![1623754121289](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623754121289.png)

Sender and receiver do not know each other, unless communicated via a message

- Reliable data transfer protocol (RDT) interfaces
  - `rdt_send()`: called from above (by app). Passed data to deliver to receiver upper layer
  - `udt_send()`: called by RDT to transfer packet over unreliable channel
  - `rdt_rcv()`: called when packet arrives on receiver side of channel
  - `deliver_data()`: called by RDT to deliver data to upper layer

**Initial attempt**

- Stop and wait: sender sends one packet, then waits for the response
- Communicate with ACK and retransmit on failure to deal with bit flips
  - Add checksum to ACK, and use sequence number to deal with bit flips on ACK
- Use countdown timer to interrupt after "reasonable" amount of time to deal with packet losses

- The performance of above method is not good since "stop and wait" is used
  - $U_{sender}$: utilization - fraction of time sender busy sending
  - example: 1 Gbps link, 15 ms prop. delay, 8000 bit packet then
    - time to transmit packet into channel: $D_{trans} = \frac{L}{R} = 8ms$
    - $U_{sender} = \frac{L/R}{RTT+L/R} = \frac{0.008}{30.008} = 0.00027$, which is really bad

**Solution: pipelined protocols operation**

- $n$-packet pipelining increases utilization by a factor of $n$
- Go-Back-N
  - sender: "window" of up to $N$, consecutive transmitted but unACKed pkts
    - $k$-bit seq number in pkt header
    - ![1623759238953](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623759238953.png)
    - ![1623759972181](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623759972181.png)
- Selective repeat
  - Receiver individually acknowledges all correctly received packets
    - buffers packets, as needed, for eventual in-order delivery to upper layer
    - sender times-out/retransmits individually for unACKed packets
      - sender maintains timer for each unACKed pkt
      - sender Window size limits the number of on-flight packets
    - ![1623760546270](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1623760546270.png)
    - A fatal error: cannot use only $N+1$ seq numbers when the window size is $N$



### Connection-oriented transport: TCP

TCP has following **properties**:

- point to point: one client, one server
- reliable, in-order byte stream: no "message boundaries"
- full duplex data: bi-direction data flow in same conection
- connection-oriented: handshaking (exchange of control messages) initializes sender, receiver state before data exchange
- pipelining: TCP congestion and flow control set window size
  - MSS: maximum segment size
- cumulative ACKs
- flow controlled: sender will not overwhelm receiver
- congestion controlled: sender will not overwhelm the network

**TCP segment structure**

- TCP header has varying size
- ![1624582972073](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1624582972073.png)

**TCP sequence numbers, ACKs**

*Sequence numbers*: byte stream number of first byte in segments data

*Acknowledgements*: seq number of next byte expected from other side

**TCP round trip time, timeout**

- TCP timeout value: longer than RTT, but RTT varies

- **SampleRTT**: measured time from segment transmission until ACK receipt, used to estimating RTT
  - Exponential weighted moving average (EWMA): $$EstimatedRTT = (1-\alpha)*EstimatedRTT + \alpha*SampleRTT$$
  - typical value : $\alpha = 0.125$
- timeout interval: $EstimatedRTT + 4*DevRTT$
- $$DevRTT = (1-\beta)*DevRTT + \beta * |SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT|$$

#### **TCP Sender**

- event: data received from application
  - create segment with seq number
  - seq number is byte-stream number of first data byte in segment
  - start timer if not already running
    - think of timer as for oldest unACKed segment
    - expiration interval: $TimeOutInterval$
- event: timeout
  - retransmit segment that caused timeout
  - restart timer
- event: ACK received
  - if ACK previously unACKed segments
    - update what is know to be ACKed
    - start timer if there are still unACKed segments

#### **TCP receiver**

- event: arrival of **in-order** segment with expected seq number
  - if All data up to expected seq number already ACKed
    - delayed ACK, wait up to 500 ms for next seg. If no next seq, send ACK
  - else
    - immediately send single cumulative ACK
- event:  arrival of **out-of-order** segment higher than expected seq number
  - immediately send **duplicate ACK**, indicating seq number of next expected byte

- event: arrival of segment that partially or completely fills gap
  - immediately send ACK

**TCP fast retransmit**

If sender receives 3 additional ACKs for same data ("triple duplicate ACKs"), resend unACKed segment with smallest seq number

#### TCP flow control

We do not want the network layer delivers data faster than application layer removes data from socket buffers

On each ACK, receiver will indicate the remaining space in receiver side TCP socket buffer by filling in $window$ $size$ field in the header. By doing so, the receiver controls sender.

- TCP receiver "advertises" free buffer space in $rwnd$ field in TCP header
- sender limits amount of unACKed data to received $rwnd$
- If sender receives a $rwnd$ of 0, then it will send nothing to the receiver. However, when the buffer is cleared, the receiver cannot tell the sender since it can only ACK data from the sender. This seems a deadlock.
  - ?

#### TCP connection management

before exchanging data, sender/receiver "handshake":

- agree to establish connection

### Principles of congestion control

**Congestion**:

- too many sources sending too much data too fast for network to handle
- manifestations:
  - long delays (queueing in router buffers)
  - packet loss (buffer overflow at routers)

**Causes/costs of congestion**

- Premature timeout -> retransmission -> un-needed duplicates
- more work (retransmissions) for given receiver throughput
- unneeded retransmissions: link carries multiple copies of a packet thus decreasing maximum achievable throughput

**Approaches towards congestion control**

- end-to-end congestion control
  - No external information from the internet
  - TCP uses this method
- network-assisted congestion control
  - routers provide direct feedback to sending/receiving hosts with flows passing through congested router
  - may indicate congestion level or explicitly set sending rate

### TCP congestion control

- **AIMD** approach: senders can increase sending rate until packet loss occurs, then decrease sending rate on loss event
  - **additive increase:** increase sending rate by 1 maximum segment size (MSS) every RTT until loss detected
  - **multiplicative decrease:** cut sending rate in half at each loss event

- **slow start**: when connection begins, increase rate exponentially until first loss event
  - initially $cwnd$ = 1 MSS
  - double $cwnd$ every RTT
  - done by incrementing $cwnd$ for every ACK received

- When $cwnd$ reaches $ssthresh$, we switch the exponential increase to linear
- For TCP Reno
  - if loss (timeout) occurs, $cwnd$ is set to 1 and slow start again, $ssthreash$ is set to 1/2 previous $cwnd$ 
  - if 3 duplicate ACKs happens, $cwnd$ is set to $ssthreash$ and increases linearly

**TCP Explicit congestion notification (ECN)**

Some TCP deployments implement *network-assisted* congestion control:

- two bits in IP header (ToS field) marked by network router to indicate congestion
- congestion indication carried to destination
- destination sets ECE bit on ACK segment to notify sender of congestion
- involves both IP and TCP

#### TCP fairness

Fairness goal: if $K$ TCP sessions share same bottleneck link of bandwidth $R$, each should have average rate of $R/k$

However, UDP send audio/video at constant rate, tolerate packet loss. Thus UDP will take the throughput of TCP.

#### TCP cubic

![1624592394152](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1624592394152.png)

- K: point in time when TCP window size will reach $W_{max}$
- increase $W$ as a funciton of the cube of the distance between current time and $K$
  - larger increases when further away from $K$
  - smaller increases when nearer $K$
- default in Linux, most popular TCP for popular Web servers

### Evolution of transport-layer functionality

- TCP, UDP: principal transport protocols for 40 years
- Moving transport-layer functions to application layer, on top of UDP
  - HTTP/3: QUIC

**QUIC: Quick UDP Internet Connection:**

- application-layer protocol, on top of UDP
  - increase performance of HTTP
  - deployed on many Google servers, apps (Chrome, youtube)
  - error and congestion control
  - connection establishment
- multiple application-level streams multiplexed over single QUIC connection
  - separate reliable data transfer, security
  - common congestion control

- Connection establishment faster than TCP+TLS combination, but provide all the functionalities of TCP+TLS



## Chapter 4: Network layer, data plane

- The network layer takes segment from sending host to receiving host.

- Network layer protocols in every internet device: hosts, routers
- Router: examines header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it, and moves datagram from input port to output port along end to end path

**Two key network-layer functions in a router:**

- routing: determine route taken by packets from source to destination
- forwarding: move packets from a router's input link to appropriate router's output link

**Two planes:**

- ***Data plane:*** local, per-router function, determines how datagram arriving on router input port is forwarded to router output port
- ***Control plane:*** network-wide logic, determines how datagram is routed among routers along end-end path from source host to destination host

- ![1625103600607](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1625103600607.png)

**Network-layer service model**

- **Best effort** service model: no guarantee on everything, including successful datagram delivery, timing or order of delivery, bandwidth available to end-end flow, etc.

### Inside a router

**Input port functions**

- ![1625104064520](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1625104064520.png)

- **Decentralized switching** (red box)

  - using header field values, lookup output port using forwarding table in input port memory
  - **destination-based forwarding**: forward based only on destination IP address (traditional)
  - **generalized forwarding**: forward based on any set of header field values

  - When the rate of arriving datagram is higher than the transmission speed of switch fabric, the datagrams are queued

- Longest prefix match: when looking for forwarding table entry for given  destination address, use longest address prefix that matches destination address

  - often performed using ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs)
  - present address to TCAM: retrieve address in one clock cycle, regardless of table size

**Switching fabrics**

- If switch fabric slower than input ports combined: queueing may occur at input queues, which may leads to buffer overflow
- **Head-of-the-Line (HOL) blocking**: queued datagram at front of queue prevents others in queue from moving forward

**Output port queuing**

- Buffering required when datagrams arrive from fabric faster than link transmission rate. 

  - **Drop policy** is implemented to decide which datagram to drop if no free buffer

  - **Scheduling discipline** is implemented to decide which datagram in queue is first transmitted

    - FCFS

    - Priority: arriving traffic classified and queued by class (any header fields can be used for classification)

      ![1625105383797](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1625105383797.png)

    - Round robin / weighted fair queuing (WFQ): when having multiple queues, we want to process them by weight.

  - Packets in the queue may get **marked** to indicate which packets to signal congestion

- The size of the buffer should be typical RTT (250ms) times link capacity (10Gbps) = 2.5Gb for example.

### Internet Protocol

**IP Datagram format** **(IPV4)**

- The size of the header is not static
- ![1625106062227](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1625106062227.png)

**IP fragmentation/reassembly**

- links have MTU (max transfer size): largest possible link-level frame
- large IP datagram divided ("fragmented") within net
  - "reassembled" only at destination
  - IP header bits used to identify, order related fragments

- ![1625106579630](C:\Users\59129\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1625106579630.png)
  - 185 = 1480 / 2^3 since the offset is 3-bit shorter than the full address length

#### IP addressing

- IP address: 32-bit identifier associated with each host or router **interface**

- **Interface**: connection between host/router and physical link
  - routers typically have multiple interfaces
  - host typically has one or two interfaces (e.g. wired Ethernet, wireless 802.11)

**Subnets**

A network that interfaces can physically reach each other **without passing through an intervening router**

- IP addresses have structure: 
  - **subnet part:** devices in same subnet have common high order bits
  - **host part**: remaining low order bits
- Subnets defined by address and mask
  - subnet mask: /24 (high-order 24 bits: subnet part of IP address), 255.255.255.0

**Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR) addressing**

- subnet portion of address of arbitrary length
- address format: a.b.c.d/x, where x is the number of bits in subnet portion of the address

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**

- dynamically get address from as server
  - can renew its lease on address in use
  - allows reuse of addresses (only hold address while connected/on)
  - support for mobile users who join/leave network
- Application layer protocol on UDP
- Typically, DHCP server runs on the router, serving all subnets to which router is attached
